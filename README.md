🧠 Diabetes Prediction Machine Learning Project

This project predicts whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on various medical diagnostic measurements. It combines data analysis, machine learning, and interactive web applications to provide an end-to-end predictive solution.

🚀 Features

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handled missing values and scaled features for better model performance.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized patterns using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

Model Training & Evaluation: Built and trained multiple machine learning models including Logistic Regression, evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and other metrics.

Interactive Web App: Created a Streamlit application to allow users to input health data and get real-time diabetes predictions.

Code & Environment: Developed in Spyder IDE, well-structured, and documented Python code.

🧩 Tech Stack

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn (for model training and evaluation)

Matplotlib / Seaborn (for data visualization)

Streamlit (for interactive web application)

Spyder IDE (for development and testing)

Pickle (for saving trained models and scalers)

📊 Dataset

The dataset contains patient medical details such as:

Pregnancies

Glucose Level

Blood Pressure

Skin Thickness

Insulin Level

BMI

Diabetes Pedigree Function

Age

The target variable is Outcome: whether the patient is diabetic or not.

🎯 Objective

To develop a reliable machine learning model that can assist in early detection of diabetes and support medical decision-making.

🖥️ How to Run

Open the project in Spyder or your preferred Python IDE.
