# 🧠 Diabetes Prediction Machine Learning Project

This project aims to predict whether a person is likely to have diabetes or not based on medical diagnostic measurements.  
It uses **Logistic Regression** and other ML techniques to analyze health data and make accurate predictions.

## 🚀 Features
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Pandas and Matplotlib  
- Model Training using Logistic Regression  
- Accuracy Evaluation and Confusion Matrix Visualization  
- User-friendly and well-documented Python code

## 🧩 Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains patient details such as:
- Pregnancies
- Glucose Level
- Blood Pressure
- Skin Thickness
- Insulin Level
- BMI
- Diabetes Pedigree Function
- Age  
and the outcome (Diabetic or Not Diabetic).

## 🎯 Objective
To build a reliable machine learning model that can predict diabetes and assist in early medical diagnosis.
